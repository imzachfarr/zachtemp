### Step 3: Update Your Code
Replace the placeholder URLs in `src/app/page.tsx`:

  thumbnailUrl="https://your-hosting-provider.com/your-thumbnail.jpg"
  allowPause={false}
  allowSeek={false}
  allowRewind={false}
  showProgress={true}
  // ... rest of props
/>
```

### Step 4: Create a Compelling Thumbnail
- Design a thumbnail that entices clicks
- Include text overlay if needed
- Use tools like Canva or Figma
- Dimensions: 1920x1080 (16:9 aspect ratio)

- ✅ No pausing (optional)
- ✅ No right-click context menu
- ✅ No download options
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Prevents user from skipping ahead

## 📊 Analytics Integration

You can track video engagement by adding analytics to the `onTimeUpdate` callback:

```tsx
onTimeUpdate={(currentTime, duration) => {
  // Track milestones
  const percentWatched = (currentTime / duration) * 100;
  
  if (percentWatched >= 25 && !milestone25) {
    // Send analytics event for 25% watched
    gtag('event', 'video_progress', {
      video_title: 'VSL',
      progress: 25
    });
  }
  
  // Show CTA at 90%
  if (currentTime >= duration * 0.9) {
    setShowCTA(true);
  }
}}
```
